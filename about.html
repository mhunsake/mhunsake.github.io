  <h1>Get to know Salmonella Sailor</h1>
  <h2>Who am I? No, who are you!</h2>
  <p>Salmonella Sailor was founded in 2019 by Green Kazoo and Blue Kazoo. Born in the Pacific Ocean and raised by kazoos in a stranded boat, they survived by blasting sea shanties at passing ships until they threw them food to make them stop. After finally breaking free and swimming to safety in 2019, they began recording their music. Blue Kazoo vanished after the recording of Sledgehammer Beat, returning to the ocean, and has not been seen since.</p>
